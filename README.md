# Mid to Long term goals
* Build a impactful Solidity library.
  * Current Status: Brainstorming for ideas.
* Build an open-sourced decentralised side-project:
  * Current Status: React.js skills need some work
  * Current Idea: De-centralised Upwork/Fiverr (with on-chain contracts and payment settlements and so on)
* Gain 1k+ reputation of ethereum.stackexchange.com
* Hopefully, upload a contract on r/ethdev someday and not get completely roasted
* Become one of the top Blockchain (Solidity) developers
